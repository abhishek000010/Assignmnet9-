    "Q1 -> What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",

    "Ans -> Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages.\n",
    "That enables the user to implement even more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden background/back-end complexity.\n",

    "Q3 -> What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -> The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes\". It is used to define abstract base classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated themselves, but can be subclassed to create concrete classes.\n",
    "Abstract base classes are useful for creating a common interface or API that multiple concrete classes can implement in their own way. For example, if you have a set of classes that need to perform some common functionality,\n",
    "you can define an abstract base class that defines that functionality, and then have each concrete class subclass the abstract base class to implement that functionality in their own way.\n",
    "The abc module provides tools for creating and working with abstract base classes in Python. It includes the ABC class, which is the base class for defining abstract base classes, as well as decorators like @abstractmethod and \n",
    "@abstractproperty for defining abstract methods and properties that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.\n",

    "Q4 -> How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -> Data abstraction is a programming concept that refers to the ability to hide the implementation details of data objects from the users of that data. This can be achieved in a number of ways, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. By defining a class, you can control how users of that class interact with its data, and prevent them from accessing or modifying that data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Abstract classes and interfaces are used to define a common interface or API that multiple concrete classes can implement in their own way. By defining abstract classes or interfaces, you can hide the implementation details of concrete classes from their users, and provide a more generalized view of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Access Modifiers: Access modifiers, such as public, private, and protected, can be used to control how data is accessed and modified in a program. By defining data members as private, for example, you can prevent users from directly accessing or modifying that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Data Hiding: Data hiding is the practice of restricting access to certain data members or methods of a class, in order to prevent users from modifying or accessing them directly. This can be achieved by defining data members as private, and providing access to them only through getter and setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, data abstraction can be achieved through techniques such as encapsulation, abstract classes and interfaces, access modifiers, and data hiding. By using these techniques, you can hide the implementation details of data objects from their users, and provide a more abstract and generalized view of the data. This can make your code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain over time."
